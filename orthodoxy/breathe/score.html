<p>&ldquo;Please rise in body or in spirit.&rdquo;
<i>twenty seconds</i>
<p>&ldquo;I would like us to begin this evening with a brief listening exercise. First, I would like you to close your eyes and draw your attention to your breathing.&rdquo;
<i>thirty seconds</i>
<p>&ldquo;Pay careful attention to every inhale and every exhale.&rdquo;
<i>forty seconds</i>
<p>&ldquo;Now, focus your listening on the spacious silence of the room around us.&rdquo;
<i>twenty seconds</i>
<p>&ldquo;With your eyes closed, listen to the silence coming from each of the walls. The wall to your right, to your left, behind, from the doors where you entered. Listen to the hollow silence coming from the smaller chamber in the balcony.&rdquo;
<i>seventy seconds</i>
<p>&ldquo;Return to your breathing.&rdquo;
<i>thirty seconds</i>
<p>&ldquo;Now, focus on your exhale. Make each new out-breath just slightly longer than the last, gradually stretching out.&rdquo;
<i>fifty seconds</i>
<p>&ldquo;At last, allow the wind of every out-breath to make a little sound. Draw your attention to the sound of this air moving.&rdquo;
<i>forty seconds</i>
<p>&ldquo;With each additional breath out, allow more of your body to vibrate. This is the foundation of all sound.&rdquo;
<i>sixty seconds</i>
<p>&ldquo;At last, loosen your voice ever so slightly. To each exhale, add the quietest hum.&rdquo;
<i>forty seconds</i>
<p>&ldquo;With each new breath, free your voice slightly more.&rdquo;
<i>sixty seconds</i>
<p>&ldquo;Looser, freely&rdquo;
<i>ninety seconds</i>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, with each exhale, slowly work your way back to your regular breathing.&rdquo;
<i>sixty seconds</i>
<p>&ldquo;You may open your eyes and be seated.&rdquo;
