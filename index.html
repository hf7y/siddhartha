		<p>A bright, colorful and geometric pattern reminiscent of stained
		glass is projected onto the back wall of the stage.</p>
		<p>After the audience is seated, the organist begins playing “Introit.”</p>
		<p>Electronics route the sound to a surround-sound speaker array,
		exciting the entire hall.</p>
		<p>Priest enters from the back of the hall accompanied by Lover 1 and
		Lover 2 acting as altar-servers. Lover 1 carries a swinging thurible 1
		introducing incense into the space.
		<p>Performers walk at a stately pace towards the front of the hall and
		ultimately mount the stage.</p></details>

		<summary>2 Breathe (10')
			<a href="orthodoxy/breathe/score.html">[score]</a></summary>
		<p>At the conclusion of the organ “Introit,” the Priest commands the
		audience to rise from their seats with amplified voice.</p>
		<p>The priest then leads the audience in “Breathe,” a breathing
		sequence accompanied with projected text.</p></details>
	<details>
		<summary>3 Homily (5')</summary>
		<p>Priest tells the audience something he truly believes the
		audience needs to hear in “Homily.”</p>
		<p>Live video collages a close-up of the priest’s face onto the back
		drop.</p>
		<p>Amplified voice becomes increasingly distorted and the video back
		drop begins to dissolve. Fade to blackout as the Priest’s voice
		echoes through the hall.</p></details></details open>

		<p>Enter Lover 1 and Lover 2 carrying a blanket. They set the blanket
		on the ground before sitting down upon it.</p>
		<p>Lovers whisper and embrace. Meaningless small-talk begins to
		work its into a revealing and difficult disclosure.</p>
		<p>Closely placed microphones amplify whispers throughout the hall’s
		surround sound.</p>
		<p>Sunset backdrop transitions to night as the Lovers decide to go to
		sleep together one last time.</p></details>
